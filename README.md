# Data-Portfolio

I am a junior analyst with an interest in data science and machine learning. This portfolio primarily consists of machine learning projects on the Jupyter notebook written in Python 3.5.0. The majority of the projects are variations of online tutorial projects designed to help me become more proficient in cleaning data and writing machine learning algorithms. 

Feel free to browse at your leisure.
