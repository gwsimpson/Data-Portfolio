# Data-Portfolio

I am a PhD student in mathematics at the university of Sussex. After submission in September 2018, I am looking for a job. I am interested in the IT field, so I have started an account on Github where I can attempt projects by myself & upload them. Most of the projects here are codes I have made by following altered versions of online tutorials & through self-study. This repository can be considered my personal project portfolio for my first job.
