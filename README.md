# Data-Portfolio

I am a PhD student in mathematics at the university of Sussex. In October 2018, I will be starting as a junior analyst. I started an account on Github because I have an interest in data science & machine learning. This means that most of the projects here are related to these topics. Most of the projects are codes I have made by following altered versions of online Python & R tutorials through self-study.
